# deltanet
this is an implementation of the paper "Parallelizing Linear Transformers with the Delta Rule over Sequence Length" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06484) 
it implement also the paper "Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12537)

# requirement 
All you need is pytorch
